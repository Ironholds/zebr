## zebr - a client library for The Setup's API

### Installation
    library(devtools)
    install_github("ironholds/zebr")
 
### FAQ
#### What?
[The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) does interviews with interesting people and finds out what software and hardware they
use, both in this reality and in a utopian one. It has [a teeny-tiny API](http://usesthis.com/api/), and even small
APIs are better with client libraries. So I wrote one! Install it, get interview metadata or data
with <code>get_interviews()</code>, software metadata/data with <code>get_software()</code>, and hardware
metadata/data with <code>get_hardware()</code>

#### Why?
It was 5am. Also, I wanted to do some analysis of what software and hardware people are using, both as a pop research
project and to inform my own (future) decisions.

Also? This thing is written around httr. Or to put it another way, thanks to this package, you can now
[Hadley](http://hadley.wickham.usesthis.com/) while you [Hadley](https://github.com/hadley/httr/) your
[Hadley](https://github.com/Ironholds/zebr/blob/master/R/get.R#L21).

Basically what I'm saying is: the combination of sleep deprivation and the opportunity to make terrible jokes
referencing [late-noughties memes](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/xzibit-yo-dawg) is, let's be honest, probably
the driving motivation behind most of my software development.
Hell, we only got a [Star Wars client library](https://github.com/Ironholds/rwars) because I wanted to make a pun
about Alderaan.

#### So you're a terrible person. And, it's "zebr" because...?
Make that sleep deprivation, late-noughties memes and [late-noughties surf-pop-punk-rap...things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_bR9EXA1r4).
